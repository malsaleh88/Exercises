### Introduction:
We set up a network for Hackers Poulette, a new startup. They wanted a network that could grow as their team grows and connect everyone to the internet.

### Objectives:
Our goals were to create a simple network for the current team, make sure everyone could talk to each other, and give them all internet access.

### Network Design:
We connected three PCs (PC-Robert, PC-Camille, and PC-Renaud) to a Cisco switch using Ethernet cables.

### IP Addresses:
Each PC got its own number so they could find each other easily:

- PC-Robert: 192.168.1.10
- PC-Camille: 192.168.1.11
- PC-Renaud: 192.168.1.12
### Steps:

1. We told each PC its number.
2. We connected them to the switch.
3. We set up the router so the PCs could use the internet.

### Scalability:
The network can grow easily. We can add more devices without any big changes.

### Conclusion:
We made a network that's simple, works well, and can grow with Hackers Poulette. We'll keep an eye on it to make sure it stays running smoothly.
