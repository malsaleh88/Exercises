- yes at the bigining we couldnt see anything on the browser then the web site appear .
- nothing 
- under the in layers and out layers you can find The HTTP client sends a HTTP request to the server.
- Sent segment information: the sequence number 1, the ACK number 1, and the data length 102. 
The dst port is 80
-the destination ip is 192.168.1.254
-1. The next-hop IP address is a unicast. The ARP process looks it up in the ARP table.
2. The next-hop IP address is in the ARP table. The ARP process sets the frame's destination MAC address to the one found in the table.
3. The device encapsulates the PDU into an Ethernet frame
-the ip address of the source and the ip address of the destination 
-the source port and the destination port
-he "Host" field in HTTP is associated with the Application Layer (Layer 7) of the OSI Model
-HTTP Data:Connection: close


I used ping 10.1.1.1 
ping 10.1.1.2
ping 10.1.1.5

1.1 What type of wedge did you use to connect the PCs to the switch?
-In a standard Ethernet connection, 
when you connect a device (like a PC) to a switch, you use a straight-through cable.
The reason for this is that the switch and the device (PC) operate at different OSI layers

1.2 What type of cable did you use to connect the two switches? Explain the reason for this choice of cable.
-Using a copper crossover cable to connect two switches is necessary 
because switches typically operate at the same OSI layer (Data Link Layer, Layer 2).
